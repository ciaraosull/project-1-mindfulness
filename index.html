                        <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
                        <p>Our mind can wander, we can become out of touch with our body, and we can become preoccupied with thoughts about something that has happened or worries about the future.  But Mindfulness can bring us back to the present moment, where we are, what we’re doing and how we are feeling.  Being mindful is something we already can do, but we may need to learn and practice how to tap into this ability.</p><br>
                        <h3>Simply being aware of what is happening right now without wishing it were different. Enjoy the pleasant without holding on when it changes. Being with the unpleaseant and knowing it won't always be this way</h3>

                            Mindfulness contributes to our satisfaction with life by allowing us not to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past.

                            It can also increase our attention to other people’s well-being to help us gain stronger, more meaningful connections with others.

                            Studies have shown that mindfulness can help relieve stress, treat heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, and improve sleep.
