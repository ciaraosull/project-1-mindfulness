                    <h2>What is Mindfulness?</h2>
                    <p>Our mind can wander, we can become out of touch with our body, and we can become preoccupied with thoughts about something that has happened or worries about the future.  But Mindfulness can bring us back to the present moment, where we are, what we’re doing and how we are feeling.  Being mindful is something we already can do, but we may need to learn and practice how to tap into this ability.</p>

                    <h2>The Benefits of Mindfulness</h2>
                    <p>Mindfulness contributes to our satisfaction with life by allowing us not to get caught up in worries about the future or regrets over the past
                        It can also increase our attention to other people’s well-being to help us gain stronger, more meaningful connections with others.
                        Studies have shown that mindfulness can help relieve stress, treat heart disease, lower blood pressure, reduce chronic pain, improve sleep, and help alleviate gastrointestinal problems.
                        Mindfulness benefits our mental health as studies have also shown it can help with stress, depression, substance abuse, eating disorders, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
