# **Mindfulness**

[View the live project here](https://ciaraosull.github.io/project-1-mindfulness/index.html)

<div style="text-align: justify">Mindfulness is a website designed for a not-for-profit organisation called be.here.now.  This site aims to provide free mindfulness education and resources to adults.  The site is targeted towards those who have very little knowledge of mindfulness and wish to learn more.  It will also give an introductory mindfulness audio session where users can try out mindfulness to see what it is like.  There is the opportunity for users to sign up to monthly emails supporting them with further learning and practice.  Also, there will be links for the users to have access to downloading the app where they can continue their mindfulness practice.</div><br />

## Features
1. **Header**

    The header is puposly fixed to the top of the screen.  As this website contains one page with many sections, this fixed header design, is useful to the user to navigate with ease without having to constantly scroll up and down.  The colour choice of dark gray for background and white for the font was chosen to contrast each other for reading accessibility.  

    * Logo
        * The header contains the logo on the top left for larger screens and is adjusted to top center for smaller screens for responsiveness.  

        * The logo is linked to the landing page for ease of navigation for the user, no matter what section they are on they can click the logo in the top left to navigate back.  

        * The logo, when hovered over, responds by expanding slightly to inform the user that it is interactive.
        
        * The logo is also in a different font to the rest of the website.  This is to help it stand out as a logo from the rest of the text and also for consistancy thoughout the site the same font is used whenever the logo name appears.

    * Navigation Bar
        * The header also contains the navigtion bar.  This is conventionally located on the top right for larger screens and is adjusted to center, under the logo, for smaller screens to aid responsiveness.
        
        * The navigation bar contains key words that link to each section of the website.  Again this is designed to for ease for the user to navigate instantly without having to scroll.

        * The navigation links, when hovered over, respond by expanding slightly to inform the user that it is interactive.  A white underline also appears under the word that has been clicked to inform the user that they are currently on that section.
